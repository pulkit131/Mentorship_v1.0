# Payment Requirement Implementation

## Problem Statement
Users were able to book sessions without making payments, even when there was no waitlist. The requirement is: **"Book only after payment, but can join waitlist without paying"**.

## Summary of Changes Made

### ✅ **Backend Changes**

1. **Updated Booking Service** (`backend/services/bookingService.js`)
   - Moved payment verification to the very beginning of the booking process
   - Added `requiresPayment: true` flag to error responses when payment is missing
   - Payment check now happens before any other validation (mentor capacity, time slots, etc.)
   - Added multiple payment status support: `['completed', 'success', 'paid']`
   - Added debug logging to track payment verification process
   - Plan type validation moved after payment check

2. **Updated Booking Controller** (`backend/controllers/bookingController.js`)
   - Added `requiresPayment` flag to error responses
   - This allows frontend to distinguish between payment errors and other errors

3. **Added Debug Endpoint** (`backend/controllers/userController.js`)
   - New endpoint: `GET /api/users/debug/:userId`
   - Shows user's current plan type and payment status
   - Lists all payments for the user
   - Helps troubleshoot payment issues

### ✅ **Frontend Changes**

1. **Updated Booking Store** (`src/store/useBookingStore.js`)
   - Enhanced error handling to detect `requiresPayment` flag
   - Re-throws errors with payment requirement to let components handle navigation

2. **Updated BookSessionForm** (`src/Home/BookSessionForm.jsx`)
   - Added specific handling for payment requirement errors
   - Shows a SweetAlert dialog asking users to subscribe
   - Redirects to `/subscriptions` page when user confirms
   - Updated form title and descriptions to reflect payment requirement
   - Added helpful note about subscription requirement

### ✅ **Key Business Logic Changes**

1. **Payment-First Approach**
   - All booking attempts now check for payment first
   - No booking can proceed without a valid payment
   - Clear error messages guide users to subscription page

2. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Clear messaging about subscription requirement
   - Smooth navigation to subscription page
   - Helpful alerts and notifications

3. **Waitlist vs Booking Distinction**
   - **Waitlist**: No payment required (users can join waitlists freely)
   - **Booking**: Payment required (users must subscribe to book sessions)

## Solution Overview

### ✅ **Backend Changes**

#### 1. Updated Booking Service (`backend/services/bookingService.js`)
**Key Changes:**
- **Payment Check First**: Payment verification now happens BEFORE any other validation
- **Multiple Status Support**: Checks for `['completed', 'success', 'paid']` status values
- **Debug Logging**: Added console logs to track payment verification process
- **Plan Type Check After Payment**: Plan type validation moved after payment check

**Flow:**
```javascript
// 1. Get user
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });

// 2. Check payment FIRST (before anything else)
const latestPayment = await prisma.payment.findFirst({
  where: { 
    userEmail: user.email,
    status: { in: ['completed', 'success', 'paid'] }
  },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
});

if (!latestPayment) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: 'Payment required. Please subscribe to a plan before booking sessions.',
    statusCode: 403,
    requiresPayment: true  // ← Key flag for frontend
  };
}

// 3. Check payment expiration
if (now > latestPayment.subscriptionEnds) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: 'Your payment has expired. Please renew your subscription.',
    statusCode: 403,
    requiresPayment: true
  };
}

// 4. Check plan type
if (user.planType === 'BASIC') {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: 'Basic plan users cannot book sessions. Please upgrade your plan.',
    statusCode: 403,
    requiresPayment: true
  };
}

// 5. Continue with other validations...
```

#### 2. Updated Booking Controller (`backend/controllers/bookingController.js`)
**Key Changes:**
- Added `requiresPayment` flag to error responses
- Allows frontend to distinguish payment errors from other errors

```javascript
return res.status(result.statusCode).json({
  error: result.error,
  waitlistEntry: result.waitlistEntry,
  requiresPayment: result.requiresPayment  // ← Key flag
});
```

#### 3. Added Debug Endpoint (`backend/controllers/userController.js`)
**New Endpoint:** `GET /api/users/debug/:userId`
- Shows user's current plan type
- Lists all payments for the user
- Shows payment status and validity

### ✅ **Frontend Changes**

#### 1. Updated Booking Store (`src/store/useBookingStore.js`)
**Key Changes:**
- Enhanced error handling to detect `requiresPayment` flag
- Re-throws errors to let components handle navigation

```javascript
if (errorData?.requiresPayment) {
  toast.error("Payment required. Please subscribe to a plan first.");
  throw error; // Re-throw to let component handle navigation
}
```

#### 2. Updated BookSessionForm (`src/Home/BookSessionForm.jsx`)
**Key Changes:**
- Added specific handling for payment requirement errors
- Shows SweetAlert dialog asking users to subscribe
- Redirects to `/subscriptions` page when user confirms
- Updated form messaging to reflect payment requirement

```javascript
if (err?.response?.data?.requiresPayment) {
  Swal.fire({
    title: "Payment Required",
    text: "Please subscribe to a plan before booking sessions.",
    icon: "info",
    confirmButtonText: "Subscribe Now",
    showCancelButton: true,
    cancelButtonText: "Cancel"
  }).then((result) => {
    if (result.isConfirmed) {
      navigate("/subscriptions");
    }
  });
}
```

### ✅ **Business Logic Flow**

#### **Booking Attempt Flow:**
1. User fills booking form and submits
2. **Payment Check First** → System checks for valid payment record
3. If no payment → Shows "Payment Required" dialog → Redirects to subscription page
4. If payment exists → Continues with booking validation (mentor capacity, time slots, etc.)

#### **Waitlist Flow (Unaffected):**
1. User joins waitlist → No payment check required
2. User can join multiple waitlists freely
3. When user makes payment later → Waitlist entries processed automatically

#### **Payment Processing Flow:**
1. User makes payment → Payment verified and saved
2. User's plan updated
3. Waitlist entries automatically processed
4. User assigned to available mentors

### ✅ **Flow Now Works As:**

1. **User tries to book a session**
   - System checks for payment first
   - If no payment → Shows "Payment Required" dialog → Redirects to subscription page
   - If payment exists → Proceeds with booking validation

2. **User joins waitlist**
   - No payment check required
   - User can join multiple waitlists freely
   - When user makes payment later, waitlist entries are processed automatically

3. **User makes payment**
   - Payment is verified and saved
   - User's plan is updated
   - Waitlist entries are automatically processed
   - User is assigned to available mentors

### ✅ **Key Features**

1. **Payment-First Validation**
   - All booking attempts check for payment first
   - No booking can proceed without valid payment
   - Clear error messages guide users to subscription page

2. **Multiple Payment Status Support**
   - Checks for `completed`, `success`, and `paid` status values
   - Handles different payment gateway status formats

3. **Debug Capabilities**
   - Console logs track payment verification process
   - Debug endpoint shows user's payment and plan status
   - Helps troubleshoot payment issues

4. **User Experience**
   - Clear messaging about subscription requirement
   - Smooth navigation to subscription page
   - Helpful alerts and notifications

### ✅ **Testing**

#### Manual Testing:
1. Try to book without payment → Should redirect to subscription page
2. Join waitlist without payment → Should work fine
3. Make payment → Should process waitlist entries automatically
4. Book after payment → Should work normally

#### Debug Testing:
```bash
# Check user's current status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/users/debug/687aa9c09d4c09143117cfe1"

# Try to book (should fail with payment requirement)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/bookings" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "687aa9c09d4c09143117cfe1",
    "mentorId": "6879344bc72123b632ceba27",
    "timeSlot": "2025-01-22T10:00:00.000Z"
  }'
```

### ✅ **Error Handling**

- **No Payment**: `requiresPayment: true` → Redirect to subscription
- **Expired Payment**: `requiresPayment: true` → Redirect to subscription
- **Basic Plan**: `requiresPayment: true` → Redirect to subscription
- **Other Errors**: Normal error handling

### ✅ **Security Considerations**

- Payment verification uses cryptographic signatures
- User authentication required for all operations
- Database transactions ensure data consistency
- Input validation prevents injection attacks

## Result

The implementation now correctly enforces: **"Book only after payment, but can join waitlist without paying"**. Users will be properly guided to the subscription page when they try to book without payment, while waitlist functionality remains free and accessible.
